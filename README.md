Titanic Survival Prediction
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the classic Titanic dataset. The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Creates new features like Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, AgeBand, FarePerPerson, and HasCabin.

Model Training: Evaluates multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Comparison: Compares models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Feature Importance: Visualizes feature importance for each model.

Results
The best-performing model (Logistic Regression) achieved:

Accuracy: 72.62%

Precision: 70.27%

Recall: 68.42%

F1-Score: 69.33%
